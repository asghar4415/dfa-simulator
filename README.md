# DFA Simulator

Welcome to the DFA Simulator GitHub repository!

## About

The DFA Simulator is a web-based tool designed to provide an interactive environment for exploring Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). This project aims to simplify the understanding of DFA theory for students, educators, and enthusiasts by offering a user-friendly simulator with visualization capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Experiment with different inputs, states, and transitions to observe how DFA processes input strings.
- **Visualizations**: Visual representations of DFA help demystify complex concepts, making them accessible to learners at all levels.
- **Customization Options**: Customize DFA parameters to create and test your own automata, allowing for hands-on learning and experimentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DFA Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start exploring DFA concepts using the interactive simulator.
